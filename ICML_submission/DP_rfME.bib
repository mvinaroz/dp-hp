@inproceedings{papernot:private-training,
	Abstract = {{Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive,
such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may
inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis
of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.


To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to
providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of
Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion,
multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different
subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models
are not published, but instead used as "teachers" for a "student" model. The
student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the
teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying
data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both
intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the
student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These
properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also
inspect its internal workings.


Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on
how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models
like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and
SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.}},
